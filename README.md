The great Sage Michou's latest AAA game concept has been stolen! It's up to you, MrHero, to gather a team of valiant companions and retrieve it. Be the saviour of French Videogames!

What if Baldur's Gate was made by Michel Ancel (creator of Rayman and Beyond Good And Evil)? A silly game featuring :

* Slapping
* Enticing companions
* Frenglish
* Beautiful retro BG style UI
* Mouth noises
* Incredible hand-drawn graphics
* A compelling story

Made in a week for CPC's Make Something Horrible 2018 Game Jam ( https://itch.io/jam/make-something-horrible-2018 ).

All assets are hand-made (and it shows), save for a few notable exceptions :

* Royaltee-free background musics :
    * Wizardtorium and Moonlight Hall by Kevin MacLeod on Inconpetech ( https://incompetech.com )
    * The Jagables by Kazoo Funk Orchestra on FreeArchiveMusic ( http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kazoo_Funk_Orchestra/ )
* Fire and smoke effects, ground/walls textures and bird chirps from Unreal 4's starter content.

Those are all the sources used inside Unreal Engine 4 for the game.
Keep in mind this is my first stab at using UE4, and I set myself the constraint of not writing a single line of code. So, there are ugly ass blueprints in there people.
